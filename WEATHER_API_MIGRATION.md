# Weather API Migration: OpenWeatherMap → National Weather Service

## 🎯 Migration Summary

This migration removes all dependencies on OpenWeatherMap and configures the system to use exclusively the National Weather Service (api.weather.gov) for all weather data.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Weather Service Configuration**
- **Updated `app/services/weather_service.rb`**: Changed primary provider from `OpenWeatherMapService` to `NationalWeatherService`
- **Updated `config/initializers/weather_service.rb`**: Disabled OpenWeatherMap, enhanced NWS configuration
- **Updated `app/jobs/weather_update_job.rb`**: Changed error handling from OpenWeatherMap to NWS exceptions

### 2. **Data Model Updates**
- **Updated `app/models/weather_datum.rb`**: Removed OpenWeatherMap sources from validation
- **Valid sources now**: `['weather.gov', 'local_station', 'manual', 'api', 'nws', 'nws_forecast']`
- **Migrated existing data**: Updated all existing OpenWeatherMap records to use `weather.gov` source

### 3. **Service Provider Changes**
- **Disabled**: `app/services/weather_providers/open_weather_map_service.rb` → renamed to `.disabled`
- **Enhanced**: `app/services/weather_providers/national_weather_service.rb` with improved redirect handling and data parsing

### 4. **Sample Data Updates**
- **Updated `add_sample_weather.rb`**: All sample data now uses `weather.gov` and `nws` sources
- **Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: Documentation reflects exclusive use of government weather data

### 5. **API Improvements**
- **Fixed redirect handling**: NWS API redirects (301/302) are now properly followed
- **Enhanced cloud cover parsing**: Handles both structured data and text descriptions (CLR, FEW, SCT, BKN, OVC)
- **Robust error handling**: Better timeout and connection error management

## 🌐 Weather Data Sources

### Primary Source: National Weather Service (api.weather.gov)
- **Coverage**: United States and territories
- **Cost**: Free (government service)
- **API Key**: Not required
- **Rate Limits**: Reasonable for operational use
- **Data Quality**: High-quality, official meteorological data

### Data Types Available:
- Current weather observations
- Hourly forecasts
- Weather alerts and warnings
- Atmospheric stability data for dispersion modeling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Weather Service Flow:
1. **Location Input** → NWS Points API → Grid coordinates
2. **Grid Coordinates** → NWS Stations API → Nearest weather station
3. **Station ID** → NWS Observations API → Current weather data
4. **Data Processing** → Unit conversions → Application format

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /points/{lat},{lon}` - Grid data for location
- `GET /points/{lat},{lon}/stations` - Nearby weather stations
- `GET /stations/{stationId}/observations/latest` - Current observations
- `GET /gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast/hourly` - Forecasts

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Successful Tests:
- ✅ Weather data fetching from NWS API
- ✅ Unit conversions (temperature, pressure, wind speed)
- ✅ Cloud cover parsing (text and structured formats)
- ✅ Weather update job execution
- ✅ Database validation with new source restrictions

### Sample Output:
```
Testing weather service with fixed cloud cover parsing...
Success! Weather data fetched from: nws
Temperature: 21.1°C
Wind Speed: 0.0 m/s
```

## 🚀 Benefits of Migration

### Reliability:
- **Government service**: More stable and reliable than commercial APIs
- **No API keys**: Eliminates authentication complexity and key management
- **Official data**: Authoritative meteorological information

### Cost:
- **Zero cost**: No subscription fees or rate limiting concerns
- **Unlimited usage**: Suitable for operational deployment

### Compliance:
- **Government standards**: Meets regulatory requirements for official weather data
- **Data integrity**: Traceable, official meteorological observations

## 📊 Current Status

### Database Sources:
- `api` - Legacy/manual entries
- `nws` - National Weather Service observations
- `weather.gov` - National Weather Service data (primary)

### All OpenWeatherMap References Removed:
- ❌ Service provider disabled
- ❌ Configuration removed
- ❌ Validation rules updated
- ❌ Sample data migrated
- ❌ Documentation updated

## 🎉 Migration Complete

The chemical dispersion modeling system now exclusively uses official US government weather data from the National Weather Service, ensuring reliable, accurate, and cost-free weather information for all dispersion calculations and monitoring activities.
