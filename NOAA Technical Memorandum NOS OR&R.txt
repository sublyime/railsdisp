EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A description of the conceptual and mathematical models that form the basis of the ALOHA
computer application are described. ALOHA is designed for use during accidental chemical spills to
help spill response professionals assess the risk to human populations associated with toxic air
hazards, thermal radiation from fires, and blast effects.
ALOHA is designed to provide a close upper bound to the threat distances associated with chemical
spills of a scale typical of transportation accidents, with typical threat zones in the range of 100 to
10,000 meters. ALOHA is limited to hazards associated with chemical vapors or chemicals that
become airborne. ALOHA includes an extensive library of chemical property data, and models to
assess the rate at which a chemical is released from containment and vaporizes. ALOHA links
source strength models to air dispersion models to estimate the spatial extent of airborne hazards.
ALOHA uses a graphical interface for data entry, and display of results. Exposures to toxic chemical
vapors, overpressure, thermal radiation, or areas where flammable gases are present are
represented graphically and with a text summary.
Executive Summary 1
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 ABOUT ALOHA
ALOHA is a stand-alone software application developed for the Windows and Macintosh operating
systems. It was developed and is supported by the Emergency Response Division1 (ERD), a division
within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in collaboration with the
Office of Emergency Management of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Its primary
purpose is to provide emergency response personnel estimates of the spatial extent of some
common hazards associated with chemical spills. The ALOHA development team also recognizes
that ALOHA can be an appropriate tool for training and contingency planning, but users should
remain aware of its primary purpose in spill response. ALOHA provides estimates of the spatial
extent of some of the hazards associated with the short-term accidental release of volatile and
flammable chemicals. ALOHA deals specifically with human health hazards associated with inhalation of
toxic chemical vapors, thermal radiation from chemical fires, and the effects of the pressure wave from
vapor-cloud explosions.
Since ALOHA is limited to chemicals that become airborne, it includes models to assess the rate at
which a chemical is released from containment and vaporizes. These “source strength” models can
be critical components in the process of assessing hazards. ALOHA links source strength models to
a dispersion model to estimate the spatial extent of toxic clouds, flammable vapors, and explosive
vapor clouds. However, ALOHA does not model all combinations of source strength, scenario, and
hazard category for combustion scenarios. The user must choose a specific combination from a
limited selection. Table 1 shows the combination of source strength models, scenarios, and hazard
categories allowed in ALOHA.
ALOHA uses a graphical interface for data entry and display of results. The area where there is a
possibility of exposure to toxic vapors, a flammable atmosphere, overpressure from a vapor cloud
explosion, or thermal radiation from a fire are represented graphically as threat zones. Threat
zones represent the area within which the ground-level exposure exceeds the user-specified level of
concern at some time after the beginning of a release. All points within the threat zone experience a
transient exposure exceeding the level of concern at some time following the release; it is a record
of the predicted peak exposure over time. In some scenarios, the user can also view the time
dependence of the exposure at specified points.
1 The Emergency Response Division (ERD), formerly Hazardous Materials Response Division (HAZMAT),
supports emergency response and restoration activities for oil and hazardous chemical spills, provides
preparedness aids for response communities, and offers training on the scientific aspects of oil and chemical
spill response.

1.2 DESIGN CRITERIA AND LIMITATIONS
To achieve ALOHA’s function as a tool for emergency response, the following design criteria were
given priority:
ALOHA was designed to provide an assessment of threat zones using information that is commonly
available to responders during an emergency. The user is required to provide data on local
atmospheric conditions, the identity of the chemical, and details about the spill scenario. To
minimize input data requirements, an extensive database of chemical properties and geographical
data are included in ALOHA.
ALOHA is designed to provide a close upper bound to the threat distances associated with chemical
spills. Wherever uncertainty is unavoidable, ALOHA will err in favor of overestimating rather than
underestimating threat distances. In some cases, ALOHA will significantly overestimate threat
zones.
ALOHA was designed to be easy to use so that responders can use it during a spill event. ALOHA’s
user interface is designed to minimize operator error. Navigation through the model input screens
is designed to be intuitive and quick. User input data is checked for consistency and
reasonableness. Results are presented graphically.
ALOHA provides methods for estimating the release and volatilization rate of chemicals for many
common accident scenarios.
ALOHA runs quickly on small computers (PC or Macintosh) that are easily transportable and
affordable for most users.
ALOHA is designed to predict hazards associated with spills of a scale that are typical of
transportation accidents. Typical scales for threat zones are in the range of 102 to 105 meters, with
durations of up to an hour.
Introduction 3
ALOHA is limited in its ability to account for the effects associated with terrain and buildings.
ALOHA uses a wind field that does not vary with time or horizontal position, but does vary with
elevation. As such, it cannot resolve the steering effects from features in the terrain or buildings.
ALOHA is applicable to cases where the wind speed is greater than 1 meter per second (at 10
meters); it should not be used for very low wind speeds or calm conditions.
1.3 ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
ALOHA includes data compilations, source strength models, and models to estimate hazard
associated with airborne chemicals. This document describes the theoretical basis for these models,
but does not describe the computer algorithms used to solve the associated numerical problems. It
is organized into 6 chapters, each corresponding to a set of related functions performed by ALOHA.
Chapter 2 describes the databases contained within ALOHA. ALOHA includes physical, chemical,
and toxicological properties for over 500 pure chemicals and some common chemical solutions.
ALOHA also includes latitudes, longitudes, altitudes, and time zone data for many cities in the USA.
Chapter 3 encompasses the source strength models used to estimate the amount of material
becoming airborne, thereby contributing to an airborne toxic or flammable cloud. ALOHA includes
models that estimate the rate at which a chemical is released from a tank or gas pipeline, or
evaporates from a puddle. In addition, the user can directly specify the amount of chemical
entering the atmosphere.
Chapter 4 describes the air dispersion models that are at the core of ALOHA’s methodology for
estimating the inhalation hazard associated with toxic airborne chemicals, and the extent of a
flammable cloud. These air dispersion models are used to predict how the concentration of a
pollutant, once released into the air, varies with time and position. ALOHA incorporates two semiempirical air dispersion models: the Gaussian model is used to predict the wind-dominated
transport of pollutant clouds that are not significantly affected by gravity; the Heavy Gas model is
used for pollutant clouds that are significantly affected by gravity due to their densities.
Chapter 5 deals with the models employed to estimate the effects associated with a vapor cloud
explosion. In rare events, volatile chemicals released into the air have formed clouds with proper
ratios of fuel to air, ignited, and burned sufficiently quickly to produce damaging shockwaves. The
speed at which the combustion progresses through the cloud determines whether the combustion
of a vapor cloud produces a shock wave with damaging overpressures extending beyond the
bounds of the fire. ALOHA integrates air dispersion models and vapor cloud explosion models to
estimate the extent of an area affected by a damaging overpressure.
Chapter 6 describes the models used to estimate the thermal radiation hazard associated with fires.
Fires of sufficient size and duration can produce intense thermal radiation that poses a threat to
human health and safety far beyond the bounds of the fire. Many chemicals found in the ALOHA
database can be ignited and sustain a combustion when mixed with air. ALOHA can estimate the
thermal radiation from pool fires, jet fires, and fireballs associated with BLEVEs. The user can view
the peak thermal energy flux from a combustion process or thermal energy flux as a function of
time. The threat zone associated with flash fires is also described in this chapter, but the thermal
4 Introduction
radiation associated with flash fires is not explicitly modeled. ALOHA computes the area within
which the chemical vapors might exceed the lower flammability limits.
Introduction 5
2 THE INTEGRAL DATABASES
ALOHA includes data files with physical, chemical, and toxicological properties for hundreds of pure
chemicals and some common chemical solutions. The chemical data files include chemicals that
have the potential to be involved in accidental releases and generate toxic air hazards or pose the
threat of fire or explosion. The chemicals included in the ALOHA chemical library are a subset of
those found in CAMEO CHEMICALS, a database of hazardous chemicals compiled and maintained by
the Emergency Response Division of NOAA and the Office of Emergency Management in EPA (see
http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/).
2.1 TOXICOLOGICAL DATA
ALOHA employs Levels of Concern (LOC) to address the impact of toxic air plumes, fires, and
explosions on human populations. For inhalation hazards, ALOHA’s LOCs are concentrations of
airborne chemicals associated with adverse health effects. Since ALOHA is used primarily for
situations where the goal is to assess the threat posed to the general public by a chemical release, it
includes LOCs that are specifically designed to predict how the general public will respond to a
short-term release. In limited cases, exposure guidelines developed for worker safety are also
compiled and presented to users as an option.
LOCs for toxic inhalation hazards are specific to the chemicals. Thresholds for inhalation toxicity
are extracted from CAMEO Chemicals. AEGLs (Acute Exposure Guideline Levels), ERPGs
(Emergency Response Planning Guidelines), PACs (Protective Action Criteria), and IDLH
(Immediate Danger to Life and Health) limits are stored within data files integrated into ALOHA.
AEGLs, ERPGs, and PACs, are tiered public exposure guidelines developed for accidental chemical
release events. (See http://orise.orau.gov/emi/scapa/ for a more complete description.) Though
developed by different organizations, all three exposure guidelines share a similar approach in
appraising the effects of chemical exposure in their use of levels to describe the increasing severity
associated with increasing concentration. In addition, these exposure levels are differentiated by
exposure times. AEGLs have been developed for a range of exposure times; ALOHA only includes
60-minute AEGLs. ERPGs are defined for 60-minute exposures.
IDLH (Immediate Danger to Life and Health) limits (Barsan, United States. Dept. of Health and
Human Services., and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 2010) are included in
the list of LOCs available to users. They were developed primarily for making decisions regarding
respirator use. In the 1980s, before public exposure guidelines were available for most common
chemicals, the IDLH limit was used in public exposure situations. Unlike the three-tiered public
exposure guidelines, only a single IDLH value is defined for applicable chemicals.

2.2 FLAMMABILITY
ALOHA includes data on chemical flammability. The lower flammability and upper flammability
limits are included in the chemical library. These data were extracted from DIPPR (American
Institute of Chemical Engineers).
2.3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
A chemical name, CAS registry number, molecular weight, and toxicological data are included for
every chemical in the data file. These are the minimum data required for the Direct Source option
and the Gaussian dispersion model in ALOHA.
The other options in ALOHA, such as Source Strength modeling, Heavy Gas modeling, and modeling
for fires and explosions require more extensive datasets. Full datasets are available for about half
the chemicals in the data file; the additional physical property data required were extracted from
the DIPPR data compilation, a proprietary database containing physical constants and formulas for
temperature dependent properties (American Institute of Chemical Engineers). Data are available
for the following properties: critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume, freezing point,
normal boiling point, vapor pressure, liquid density, gas density, heat of vaporization, heat of
combustion, liquid heat capacity, and vapor heat capacity.
Data required to model the evaporation of solutions is stored in a separate data file. ALOHA allows
the user to model solutions within limited concentration ranges. In most cases, the upper limit is
determined by the concentration range that is commonly available for shipment commercially. The
lower limit was set such that the expected downwind air plume would be below toxic levels; the
lower limit is often the concentration of the azeotropic mixture. Partial pressure, liquid density,
liquid heat capacity, and heat of vaporization are functions of both temperature and concentration.
Tabulated partial pressure data for a range of concentration and temperature are stored in a data
file; ALOHA interpolates between data points using a linear interpolation in log(Pressure) and
(1/Temperature). Formulas for liquid density (kg/m3), liquid heat capacity (J/kg K), and heat of
vaporization (J/kg) were developed by fitting tabulated data to a polynomial equation of the form

Hydrofluoric acid solutions with concentrations between 37% by mass and 70% by mass can be
modeled in ALOHA. Though solutions with concentrations exceeding 70% are commercially
available, ALOHA does not model these due to the complexity of the chemistry. Vapor pressure
tables were extracted from Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd edition (Kirk et
al. 1978). The coefficients for the heat capacity formulas were based on a linear fit to data in the
Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th edition (Kirk et al. 1991). The coefficients
for the density formulas were based on a least squares polynomial fit to data found in Perry’s

Oleum is a mixture of sulfur trioxide and anhydrous sulfuric acid. Mixtures with concentrations of
free sulfur trioxide between 4% by weight and 65% by weight can be modeled in ALOHA.
Coefficients for the density formula were based on 3 values, 20%, 25%, and 30%, reported in the
Enviro TIPS manual (Environmental Protection Service. 1984) and a graph in Ullmann’s
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (Ullmann 2000) which showed the dependence on
temperature. Coefficients for the heat capacity formula were based on a graph in the Kirk-Othmer
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th edition (Kirk et al. 1991). Heat of Vaporization is an
average of the values presented by Brand and Rutherford (Brand and Rutherford 1952); there
appears to be no discernible dependence on concentration. The Vapor pressures for up to 34% can
be found in Brand and Rutherford, and are complemented by measurement by Schrage (Schrage
1991).

2.4 WARNINGS
In addition to data required to model release and downwind dispersion, ALOHA also includes data
used to trigger warning statements while running the model. One option in ALOHA allows the user
to model releases on water. Since ALOHA does not have the methods for modeling soluble chemical
spills on water, the user is given a warning that the chemical is soluble. Information about which
chemicals in ALOHA have solubilities exceeding 50 kg/m3 was based on data extracted from the
CHEMWATCH database (Chemwatch).
Some chemicals are sufficiently reactive that they undergo chemical reactions when in contact with
air or moisture. The ALOHA development team examined every chemical in ALOHA to determine
which would likely react sufficiently to have significant impacts on the accuracy of the dispersion
models. Information about these reactive chemicals is included in a data file.
2.5 GEOGRAPHICAL DATA
ALOHA includes latitudes, longitudes, altitudes, and time zone data for many cities in the USA.
These data are used to compute solar radiation and local ambient pressure.
10 The Integral Databases
3 SOURCE STRENGTH MODELS
3.1 BACKGROUND
The rate at which a chemical becomes airborne is critical to the size and duration of a toxic or
flammable cloud. ALOHA employs a variety of models to estimate the rate at which a chemical is
released from confinement and enters the atmosphere; these are referred to as source strength
models. ALOHA can predict source strength for four general classes of chemical releases, or
sources:
•
•
•
•
Direct. An instantaneous or continuous release of chemical vapors into the air from a single
point. This is the only option that allows for an elevated release.
Puddle. A puddle of constant area, containing either a non-boiling or boiling liquid.
Tank. A cylindrical or a spherical tank at ground level with a single hole or leaking valve.
The tank may contain a liquid, pressurized gas, or gas liquefied under pressure. Tank
contents may escape directly into the atmosphere or first form a spreading evaporating
pool.
Gas pipeline. A pressurized pipe containing gas, either connected to a very large reservoir
or unconnected to any storage vessel.
ALOHA limits the duration of any source to one hour, and the shortest source duration allowed in
ALOHA is one minute (this is termed an instantaneous release in ALOHA). In most cases, source
strength changes continuously over the duration of the release. ALOHA approximates continuously
variable releases with a series of very short steady-state releases. Up to 150 time-steps are used to
model time-varying releases. These timesteps are reduced to five or fewer steady-state timesteps
which are linked to the dispersion models.
Figure 1. An example of ALOHA’s timestep averaging scheme. ALOHA originally estimated source
strength for this release in a series of 100 timesteps; these were averaged to four timesteps for use
in predicting dispersion.
Source Strength Models 11
3.2 DIRECT SOURCE
A direct source option allows the user to directly specify the amount of chemical vapors introduced
into the air from a point in space. The user can specify an instantaneous release, or a steady-state
release of finite duration. This option can be used with gases that are denser than air and are
affected by gravity, or gases that behave as neutrally buoyant. ALOHA allows for a release above
ground level for gases that behave as neutrally buoyant.
3.3 PUDDLE SOURCE
Using the Puddle Option, users can model the evaporation of volatile chemicals from a puddle of
fixed area. A limited number of mixtures containing a toxic chemical mixed with water or a nonvolatile solvent can be modeled. In these cases the evaporation and transport of only the toxic
component is modeled. ALOHA uses one of two methods for finding the evaporation rate
depending upon whether or not the puddle is sufficiently close to its boiling point. Brighton's
formulation (Brighton 1985) is used when the average puddle temperature is sufficiently below its
boiling point, and an energy balance method is used when the puddle approaches its boiling point.
The volatilization rate of non-boiling puddles is governed primarily by the wind speed, area of the
puddle, and vapor pressure of the chemical,2 or partial pressure in cases involving mixtures.
ALOHA accounts for changes in temperature and composition, in cases involving mixtures.
Temperature is held at the boiling point for boiling puddles, and the volatilization rate is defined by
the energy balance. Turbulent diffusion is expected to be the primary mechanism transporting
vaporized material away from the puddle. Temperature and composition are assumed to be
spatially uniform throughout the puddle. As evaporation removes material, the puddle is assumed
to grow thinner, but its radius is assumed to be constantALOHA accommodates spills of volatile
chemicals on a variety of solid surfaces and on bodies of water. ALOHA assumes that the spilled
liquid does not penetrate into the soil, sink, or dissolve in water.
The methods used to compute evaporation rates from puddles of fixed area are also used with the
Tank Option to estimate evaporation rates from expanding puddles from liquid leaking from a
Tank. The modifications to accommodate spreading puddles are described in section 3.4.
3.3.1 EVAPORATION FROM NON-BOILING PUDDLES
When the average puddle temperature is below its ambient boiling point,3 ALOHA uses a model by
Brighton (Brighton 1985) to predict the evaporation rate. The model assumes that the layer of air
2 The vapor pressure is strongly dependent upon the puddle skin temperature, which can be significantly
lower than the temperature of the underlying liquid. Kawamura and Mackay (Kawamura et al. 1985)
measured skin temperatures that were 5 to 6°C lower than bulk temperatures in the same puddles. ALOHA
approximates the temperature of the puddle as spatially uniform set to the spatially averaged puddle
temperature; this can cause ALOHA to overestimate evaporation rates. 3 ALOHA defines the upper temperature limit for Brighton’s model when the correction factor for highly
volatile liquids reaches 4.

in contact with the surface of the puddle holds vapors in equilibrium with the liquid in the puddle.
As a turbulent airstream passes across the pool surface, vapor molecules diffuse passively from the
top of this vapor layer and are advected downwind.
Brighton formulated an expression for the evaporative mass flux, E xt ( ) , , in terms of the friction
velocity of the air, U* , the chemical’s vapor-phase saturation concentration, Cs , and a
dimensionless mass transfer coefficient, j x( ) :
( ) * , () E x t CU j x = s .
The mass transfer coefficient is spatially dependent on the position along the axis oriented parallel
to the wind direction. By integrating the mass transfer coefficient over the puddle dimension,4 a

As the vapor pressure of the puddle, Pv , approaches ambient air pressure, Pa , the evaporating

Source Strength Models 15
The treatment of evaporation from solutions follows this same method, but the solute and solvent
are treated independently using the physical properties of each accordingly. One simplification is
used in calculating the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient; the laminar Schmidt number is
based on a weighted average molecular weight and a single mass transfer coefficient is used for
both solute and solvent.
3.3.2 EVAPORATION FROM BOILING PUDDLES
ALOHA limits the upper bound of the puddle temperature to its ambient boiling point. Non-boiling
puddles can absorb enough thermal energy from their surroundings to boil, but it would be
extremely rare for a puddle to exceed its boiling point. Users may also set the initial puddle
temperature at, but not above, its ambient boiling point. In cases where the calculated puddle
temperature approaches boiling, or more precisely, exceeds the upper limit for Brighton’s nonboiling puddle model, ALOHA transitions to a boiling puddle model. The model is based on an
assumption of a steady-state temperature fixed at the boiling point. The evaporation rate and
associated evaporative cooling of the boiling puddle is set equal to a value which balances the
thermal energy fluxes, thereby maintaining a constant puddle temperature at its boiling point.
ALOHA allows puddles to transition from boiling to non-boiling, or the reverse. ALOHA constantly
compares the evaporation rate calculated with the boiling puddle model with the evaporation rate
calculated with Brighton’s model at its temperature limit. ALOHA chooses the method that yields
the larger evaporation rate.
3.3.3 PUDDLE ENERGY BALANCE
The magnitude of the evaporative mass flux depends on the temperature of the puddle, which is
assumed to be spatially uniform. Puddle temperature can increase or decrease with time
depending on the magnitude and sign of the six energy sources considered in ALOHA:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the net shortwave solar flux into the puddle, FS ;
the longwave radiation flux down from the atmosphere, F↓ ;
the longwave radiation flux upward into the atmosphere, F↑ ;
the heat exchanged with the substrate by thermal conduction, FG ;
the sensible heat flux from the atmosphere, FH ; and
the heat lost from the puddle by evaporative cooling, FE .

pl c is the heat capacity of the liquid (J kg-1 K-1).
3.3.3.1 Solar Radiation, FS
The solar irradiance, the flux of solar shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere, averages
about 1,368 W m-2 (Lide 1993). The net transmissivity of the atmosphere is the fraction of solar
irradiance that reaches the surface of the earth. Clouds and atmospheric particles both reflect and
absorb part of the solar irradiance before it reaches the earth’s surface. Frouin et al. (Frouin et al.
1989) reported that the maximum solar flux reaching the surface at continental and maritime
locations varied from 1,090 to 1,130 W m-2, indicating that atmospheric transmissivity at these
locations ranged from about 80 to 83 percent.
ALOHA estimates the solar radiation flux that reaches the ground at a location, given degree of
cloudiness, time, and date (Raphael 1962) as

CI is the cloudiness index (fraction of sky covered by clouds on a scale of 0 to 10) and
ϕS is the solar altitude (the angle of the sun above the local horizon).
This formula includes a correction for the fraction of solar radiation that is reflected back into the
atmosphere based on an average value for the earth’s albedo. ALOHA computes solar altitude as a
function of latitude, longitude, the time of day, and the Julian day of the year. ALOHA approximates
the solar radiation as constant over the time of the release.
Source Strength Models 17
3.3.3.2 Longwave Radiation, F↑ and F↓
Any temperature difference that exists between the puddle and the atmosphere can produce a net
loss or gain of energy through radiative energy transfer. Radiative (long wavelength) loss is based
on the Stefan-Boltzman radiation law,
4 F TP ↑ = −εσ ,
where
ε is the puddle emissivity (set equal to that of water = 0.97) and
σ is the Stefan-Boltzman constant (= 5.67 x 10-8 W m-2K-4).
ALOHA uses the following equation developed by Thibodeaux (ref. 1979) to estimate longwave
radiation downward from the atmosphere into the puddle:
( ) 4 1 F rBT ↓ = − σ a ,
where
r is the surface reflectivity to longwave radiation (set to that of water = 0.03),

3.3.3.3 Heat Exchange with the Substrate, FG
The substrate, whether ground or water, can be a large source of thermal energy for a puddle. To
estimate FG , ALOHA requires an initial value for ground or water temperature, GT . This should be
a value for the temperature far enough below the surface that temperature is relatively unaffected
by daily changes in solar radiation, rather than the surface temperature. When a general range for
substrate temperature is known or suspected, choosing a relatively high value from within this
range represents a conservative choice because it can result in a higher evaporative flux estimate.
In most cases, inaccuracies of a few degrees in either direction in an estimate of GT are expected to
have little effect on predicted evaporation rates.
3.3.3.3.1 SPILLS ON WATER
ALOHA can model insoluble floating liquids spilled on water that is warmer than 5°C. In cases
where the puddle temperature is greater than the underlying water, heat flow to the water is
neglected. This simplification acts to produce larger evaporation rates, but the effect tends to be
short-lived because evaporative cooling often quickly lowers the temperature of the puddle to that
of the water.
In cases where the puddle temperature is less than the underlying water, thermal energy flows
from the water to the puddle. Convective heat exchange can generate a large sustained heat flux.
Modeling the convective process in the water column is beyond the scope of ALOHA, so a simple
empirical model is used to estimate the heat transfer based on the temperature difference between
the water and the puddle, ∆T . The model was proposed by Webber (Webber 1991), and matches
measured results for butane on water:

where κ G is the thermal diffusivity of the ground. The ground is represented by a slab of finite
thickness, infinite in the horizontal directions. The thickness of the slab is based on an estimate of
the depth over which the temperature is affected by the puddle. We assume that the ground is
initially at a uniform temperature, the interface with the puddle is at the temperature of the puddle,
and the other interface is at the initial ground temperature. The heat equation has a simple
analytical error-function solution when the puddle temperature is constant; however, when the
puddle temperature varies with time, the solution becomes more complicated, so the heat equation
and heat flux expressions are solved numerically using a forward-stepping finite difference method.
The distance between nodes is adjusted to assure numerical stability, minimize numerical error,
and manage the computational time. To insure numerical stability the following condition should
be met:
dz dt ≥ 3κ G .
The depth over which the ground temperature is affected by the puddle is approximated by finding
the depth at which the ground temperature changes by one degree after one hour, assuming a
constant puddle temperature. If the initial temperature differential between the puddle and ground
is small, a minimum of 20°C is used to estimate the affected depth.
Comparison between this heat transfer model and experimental data suggests that a correction
factor is needed for the effective thermal conductivity of soils (Briscoe and Shaw 1980). The
effective thermal conductivity appears to be about 9 times that of the measured values for soils.

3.4 CHEMICALS RELEASED FROM A TANK
ALOHA can estimate the amount of substance released into the air as a result of a rupture of a tank.
ALOHA treats tanks containing pressurized gases, liquids at ambient pressure, gases liquefied by
refrigeration, and gases liquefied under pressure. ALOHA deals only with tanks containing a single
chemical. It does not deal with tanks that are pressurized with a second substance such as air or an
inert gas. As material is released from the tank, ALOHA reevaluates the conditions within the tanks
and can change the release rate calculation as needed.
The rate at which a chemical enters the atmosphere is limited, but not entirely determined, by the
rate at which the chemical is released from the tank. The release rate from the tank depends upon
the phase released (liquid, gas, or mixed phase), the driving pressure, and the nature of the rupture.
Two types of ruptures can be modeled: a hole in the tank wall, or a release through a short pipe or
valve. Models for a release through a hole are used for both types of ruptures when a gas or nonboiling liquid are involved; they provide reasonable overestimates for short pipes. However, for
superheated liquids and 2-phase fluids, the release rate through a hole and short pipe can differ
significantly, so the release rate model differentiates these two rupture types.
In tanks containing liquids, the release point can occur above the level of the liquid, below the level
of the liquid, or at the level of the liquid. The location of the rupture largely determines the
pressure driving the release and the phase of the effluent. Top vents are assumed to be absent.
Source Strength Models 21
Material released from a hole or short pipe can be a gas, a non-boiling liquid, a superheated liquid,
or a mixture of liquid and gas. ALOHA predicts that a released gas enters the atmosphere
immediately and disperses downwind, or ignites to form a jet fire. ALOHA predicts that a liquid
released at a temperature below its boiling point forms a puddle which then evaporates to generate
an airborne cloud. So, for non-boiling liquids, the tank release rate is linked to a puddle
evaporation model. ALOHA does not allow the user to model a pool fire that starts with a tank
release. ALOHA assumes that a superheated liquid (liquids released at a temperature above their
ambient boiling point) enters the atmosphere immediately and disperses downwind, or ignites to
form a jet fire. We expect that in many cases a superheated liquid would partially rain out to form a
puddle; however, ALOHA employs this assumption to ensure that it can provide a reasonable
overestimate of the actual source strength.
3.4.1 INTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF THE TANK
The temperature at the onset of the release is defined by the user.
To account for temperature changes during the release, ALOHA considers thermal conduction
through the tank walls that are in contact with liquid contents, and evaporative cooling due to
liquid vaporizing within that tank to fill the void created by the escaping fluid. (Cooling due to
adiabatic expansion of a gas within a tank is neglected.) This is shown as

3.4.2 INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE TANK
Tanks are assumed to be unvented and initially contain a single component that is in
thermodynamic equilibrium with its own vapors in the headspace (ALOHA does not allow for tanks
containing other gases in the head space). For tanks containing liquid, the internal pressure is
defined by the tank temperature and set equal to the vapor pressure of the liquid. Tanks containing
only gas have an additional degree of freedom, so the user must define the initial temperature and
pressure of the tank.
3.4.3 PHASE OF THE EFFLUENT FROM THE TANK
For tanks containing pressurized gases, or liquids stored below their boiling points, the phase of the
effluent is easily determined from the location of the rupture. However, for tanks containing
superheated liquids, the determination of the phase of the effluent can be complicated when the
rupture occurs in the head space. When a rupture is in or intersects the headspace of a tank
containing a liquid stored above its normal boiling point, pressure is quickly released causing the
liquid to vaporize quickly. This process can result in the formation of bubbles throughout the liquid
(homogeneous nucleation). If gas bubbles are generated faster than they can rise and pass out of
the liquid, the volume of the fluid can swell and fill the tank. The rupture in the head space can then
release a 2-phase mixture of gas and liquid resulting in a large release. In most cases, ALOHA
assumes that any rupture in the head space of a tank containing a liquid stored above its boiling
point will swell to fill the tank with a uniform bubbly 2-phase mixture. However, there are two
chemicals in ALOHA for which a more refined model is used to predict swelling: ammonia and
chlorine.
Ammonia and chlorine are treated differently than other gases liquefied under pressure. Instead of
assuming that a rupture in the head space always results the vessel filling with a uniform 2-phase
mixture, ALOHA uses a vapor disengagement calculation. The DIERS method (Fisher et al. 1992)
compares the superficial vapor velocity to the drift flux to determine whether the fluid swells to fill
the vessel. The superficial vapor velocity is defined as the volume release rate divided by the cross
sectional area of the vessel and can be interpreted as the speed at which a slug of vapor must travel
upward through the cylinder to match the release rate of the exit port. The drift flux of the boiling
2-phase fluid can be interpreted as the volume flux of gas bubbles in the boiling fluid relative to the
average flow velocity of the fluid (in ALOHA the fluid is approximated as stationary). At the surface
of the 2-phase fluid, the drift flux can be viewed as the gas flux through the surface.
Source Strength Models 23
The drift flux is the product of two terms, the bubble rise velocity, Urise , and the reference
dimensionless superficial vapor velocity, Ψ . These two terms are found from empirical studies
and take different forms depending on the flow regime. According to Leung (Leung 1994) most
single component liquids exhibit churn-turbulent (CT) flow. The measurements of the flow
behavior of ammonia made by Fauske and Associates and transmitted to us by Karlins (Karlins
1994) suggests that ammonia behaves as a CT fluid. Our assumption that chlorine behaves as a CT
fluid is based solely on Leung's expectation and is not based on empirical data. For CT flow, the
bubble rise velocity is defined as
( ) 1

  −   = ,
where
σ is the surface tension,
ρl is the density of the liquid phase,
ρ g is the density of the gas phase, and
g is the acceleration of gravity.
The reference dimensionless superficial vapor velocity depends on the average void fraction of the
2-phase fluid and is defined as
0
2
1 C
α
α
Ψ = − ,
where
α is the average void fraction and
C0 is the correlating parameter (= 1.0 for conservative estimate).
If the superficial vapor velocity is greater than the drift flux (UΨ), then the 2-phase fluid is
predicted to swell. Since the drift flux depends on the average void fraction, it varies as the fluid
swells and changes volume. If, at the point where the fluid fills the vessel, the drift flux is still less
than the superficial vapor velocity, then 2-phase venting is predicted. As material is lost, the
average void fraction of the fluid changes, and when the superficial vapor velocity becomes less
than the drift flux, 2-phase venting is predicted to cease. Generally, small leaks lead to gas release
and larger leaks lead to 2-phase venting.
The DIERS approach described above was developed for vertically oriented cylinders of constant
cross section with a release point at the top of the cylinder. Grolmes and Fisher (Grolmes and
Fisher 1994) recommend, as an acceptable approximation, modeling spherical and horizontalcylindrical vessels as vertical cylinders of equivalent volume and height. ALOHA accommodates
vessels with ruptures below the top of the vessel by modeling these systems as vertical cylinders
with heights equal to the height of the actual exit port and a volume equal to the volume of the
actual vessel below the level of the exit port.

3.4.4 RELEASE OF A LIQUID STORED BELOW ITS AMBIENT BOILING POINT
The following method is applied to holes and short pipes below or intersecting the level of the
liquid in a tank containing a liquid stored below its ambient boiling point. ALOHA calculates the
release of the liquid from the tank, the puddle formation, and the evaporation rate from the puddle.
When the liquid level drops below the bottom of the hole or pipe, ALOHA neglects any further
release of gas from head space above the liquid. The same calculation methods are used for a hole
in the tank wall and a short pipe.
3.4.4.1 Mass flow rate
ALOHA uses Bernoulli’s equation to compute the mass flow of liquid from the hole,
( ) ( ) ( )

2 2 , Qt CA P P T = dis f h a l − ρ
where Cdis is the discharge coefficient (0.61),
Af is the area of the hole times the fraction of the hole lying below the level of the liquid,
Pa is the ambient atmospheric pressure, and
Ph is the internal pressure in the tank at the height of the hole.
ALOHA assumes that the tank is not vented. When the liquid level is above the top of the hole, the
internal pressure driving the flow, Ph , is the combination of the vapor pressure of the liquid and the
hydrostatic pressure of the liquid above the hole. However, as the liquid level drops, the internal
pressure calculated in this manner can approach the ambient air pressure causing the flow to stop.
Commonly, air can be ingested back into the tank allowing flow to continue as a series of gushes. To
approximate this in ALOHA, when the computed value for Ph reaches 1.01 Pa , it is held constant at
that value (Belore and Buist 1986, Dodge, Bowels, and White 1980).
When the liquid level intersects the hole, the internal pressure at the hole is the ambient air
pressure plus the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid above the bottom of the hole.
Source Strength Models 25
3.4.4.2 Puddle Growth
The liquid release creates a spreading puddle that evaporates or burns. Evaporation or burning
acts to reduce the mass of a puddle that has been formed. The mass loss is approximately
proportional to the area of the puddle. When the tank release rate is greater than the computed
evaporation rate, ALOHA predicts that the puddle will spread. As the puddle evaporates, ALOHA
does not permit the puddle’s area to shrink; it allows the puddle depth to decrease. For spreading
puddles, ALOHA uses the method proposed by Briscoe and Shaw (Briscoe and Shaw 1980) to
compute the radius of the puddle, pr , which is described as
2 , p
p
dr
gd dt =
where p d is the depth of the puddle.
ALOHA approximates the puddle depth as uniform and terminates the spreading when the depth
drops to 5 mm, an arbitrarily chosen value.
3.4.4.3 Puddle Temperature
The temperature of the puddle has a large impact on the evaporation rate. In addition to the
sources and sinks of thermal energy described in the section on the Puddle Option, liquid added to
the puddle from the tank can either raise or lower the average temperature of the puddle. The
change in the puddle temperature is defined by the sum of the thermal flux terms:

where QT is mass flow rate into the puddle.
The thermal energy flux from the ground for a growing puddle is modeled in a way that is
conceptually consistent with the stand-alone puddle. The puddle is modeled as discrete concentric
rings of liquid in contact with the ground; as the puddle expands rings are added. The entire puddle
is assumed to be a uniform temperature, but the underlying ground temperature varies depending
upon its duration of contact with the puddle. Conduction through the ground is treated separately
for each ring; the thermal energy flux is the sum of the individual heat flux terms from each ring.
As with the puddle scenario described above, ALOHA uses one of two methods for finding the
evaporation rate depending upon whether the puddle is sufficiently close to its boiling point.
26 Source Strength Models
Brighton's formulation is used when the average puddle temperature is below its boiling point, and
an energy balance method is used when the puddle approaches its boiling point.
3.4.5 RELEASE OF A 2-PHASE MIXTURE OR A LIQUID ABOVE ITS AMBIENT
BOILING POINT
ALOHA uses the Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model for release scenarios involving an effluent
that is a superheated liquid, or a 2-phase mixture resulting from the flash boiling of a superheated
liquid (Fauske 1985, Fauske and Epstein 1987, Henry and Fauske 1971). The mass flux, G ,
through a short pipe or hole is described by
( ) ( ) 1 c 2

where,
c L is the specific latent heat of vaporization (J/kg),
g ν is the specific volume of the vapor (m3/kg),
ν l is the specific volume of the liquid (m3/kg),
P c is the heat capacity of the fluid (J/kgK),
T is the temperature (K),

∆P is the difference between inside and outside pressure (Pa),
l is the length of the pipe (m), and
el = 0.1 m.
The Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model is limited to a 2-phase flow that is predominately liquid.
The maximum value of Quality, X , for which the Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model is valid
(Quality is defined as the mass of the vapor divided by the mass of the mixture.) is
( ) (max) P gl
c
Pc T v v
X
L
− = ,
where P is the pressure of the fluid within the tank.
When the Quality of the effluent exceeds this limit, ALOHA computes the release rate based on a
fixed quality set to X ( ) max . This provides a reasonable overestimate of the actual release.
The Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model was developed to treat release scenarios involving pipes
that are shorter than 10 cm, including a pipe length set to zero and a hole in the tank wall. ALOHA
allows the user to specify whether the release is through a hole or short pipe, the latter corresponds
Source Strength Models 27
to a pipe length of 10 cm, the upper limit of the model. At the lower limit of pipe length, the
Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model reduces to the Bernoulli equation. At the upper limit of pipe
length, 10cm, the Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model approximately reduces to the homogeneous
equilibrium model, which has been shown to be applicable to typical valve geometries (Huff 1985).
For holes in a tank wall, the Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model predicts that the release rate is
proportional to the density and pressure difference at the exit port. In contrast for 10 cm pipes, the
Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model is insensitive to both density and pressure differential.
Flashing is assumed to occur in the pipe resulting in choked flow. As a result, release rates of
superheated liquids through short pipes are generally much smaller than through holes.
Upon release from the tank, ALOHA assumes that the liquid undergoes an adiabatic vaporization.
Evaporation cools the liquid as it vaporizes. If the liquid has not vaporized completely before its
temperature drops to its ambient boiling point, ALOHA assumes that the cold 2-phase mixture is in
the form of a fine aerosol and treats it as a dense gas. ALOHA does not allow the liquid to rain out
and form a puddle.
The Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model is limited by the diameter of the pipe. For large diameter
pipes, ALOHA uses an approximation to insure that the predicted release rate does not
underestimate the actual rate. For pipes greater than one meter in diameter, ALOHA reverts to the
Bernoulli equation. For pipe diameters between 0.1 and 1 meter, ALOHA interpolates between the
Homogeneous Nonequilibrium Model and the Bernoulli equation.
3.4.6 GAS RELEASE THROUGH A HOLE OR SHORT PIPE
ALOHA predicts a gas release under two conditions: the tank contains a pressurized gas, or there is
a small leak in the head space containing chlorine or ammonia liquefied under pressure. ALOHA
uses a single model which produces identical source strength estimates for holes and pipes
regardless of which rupture type its user chooses. ALOHA considers the release rate from ruptures
in the head space of tanks containing liquids stored below their boiling points as insignificant.
ALOHA uses algorithms incorporated in LEAKR, a computer model developed for Environment
Canada (Belore and Buist 1986), to predict the release rate of gases from holes and short pipes.
From the ratio of tank to atmospheric pressure, the ratio of hole width to tank length, and the
critical pressure ratio for sonic flow (a threshold pressure ratio value), ALOHA first determines
whether gas flow will be supersonic (choked) or subsonic (unchoked). If the pressure difference is
great enough, ALOHA models flow as supersonic until the pressure drops to the point at which flow
is subsonic. From then on, ALOHA computes a subsonic release rate until it predicts that tank
pressure has dropped to atmospheric pressure. The estimated rate of gas release drops over time
because the tank pressure is expected to drop as gas exits the tank, and because adiabatic
expansion is expected to cool the tank contents, further reducing pressure. In gas release cases,
ALOHA does not account for the effect of heat flux across the tank wall or for frictional differences
between tank holes and short pipes/valves.
28 Source Strength Models
ALOHA predicts whether gas outflow will be either subsonic or supersonic by computing three
ratios. The first is the ratio of atmospheric pressure to tank pressure:
/ R PP P aT = .
The second important ratio is the ratio of hole diameter to tank diameter,
/ c hT β = l l ,
where
T
l is the diameter of a spherical or cylindrical tank, and
hl is the either the diameter of a round hole or the square root of the area of a rectangular hole.
The third important ratio is the critical pressure ratio,

3.4.6.1 Choked Flow
When RP is less than or equal to Rc , mass flows from the tank at the speed of sound and is usually
choked, so that reducing downstream pressure further does not appreciably change the flow rate.

is discussed by Hanna and Strimaitis (American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Center for
Chemical Process Safety. 1989).
3.5 GAS PIPELINE
3.5.1 GENERAL COMMENTS
Only pure gas releases from pipe ruptures are considered by ALOHA. ALOHA’s gas pipeline
algorithm is based on modifications made by Wilson (Wilson, Alberta. Pollution Control Division.,
and University of Alberta. Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. 1981, Wilson et al. 1979) to a model
developed by Bell (Bell 1978). Measurements show that heat transfer to the moving gas through
the pipe walls maintains an almost isothermal condition throughout the length of the pipe except
for the last 200 hole diameters. Within 200 diameters of the hole, the flow is assumed to be
adiabatic because of the large acceleration near the end of the pipe.

3.5.2 THEORY
Wilson showed that an exponential is a solution for isothermal quasi-steady state pipe flow, and
that the release of gases from a finite length of pipe can be approximated by a double exponential of

Q is the rate of mass discharge per unit time (kg s-1),
Q0 is the initial mass flow at the time of the rupture (kg s-1),
α is a non-dimensional mass conservation factor, and
β is the release rate time constant (s).
The pressure in most pipelines is much greater than ambient pressure. Therefore, Q0 is calculated
assuming a choked flow condition, where, for a pipe, the discharge coefficient is one and the
internal pressure and temperature at the time of rupture are known, using

At the isothermal-adiabatic interface, for steady-state conditions, the model assumes an infinite

the flow rate is calculated as

where ia v is the velocity of the gas at the isothermal-adiabatic interface, and ρia is the density at
the interface. Choked flow is assumed and leads to the relationships

where the subscript r refers to the reservoir. A non-linear equation for the velocity of the gas out of

The gas pipeline release algorithm computes an array of gas release rates at different times. As in
other source routines, the length of the time interval varies such that equal amounts of mass are
released in each time step. If n is the total number of time steps, then each new time step is found
from the previous one by using a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme to find the roots of the

4 AIR DISPERSION MODELS
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The accidental release of a volatile chemical can present a threat to life and health far from the
point of release. Some chemicals are toxic by inhalation, others can pose a fire hazard. Air
dispersion models are central to predicting hazard zones associated with toxic or flammable gas
clouds. These models are used to predict how the concentration of a pollutant, once released into
the air, varies with time and position. ALOHA provides information about the concentration and
duration of exposure, but does not resolve the probability that an exposed individual will be
injured.
Vapor clouds containing a flammable chemical mixed with air can burn when an ignition source is
present. When a large quantity of a flammable chemical is released into the air and disperses to the
point where a flammable fuel/air mixture forms before ignition, the fire can travel from the ignition
source to the edges of the flammable cloud. The rate at which the combustion propagates through
the cloud determines whether a damaging shock wave is generated (a vapor cloud explosion). The
hazards associated vapor cloud explosions are described in Chapter 5. Hazards associated with
flash fires, which do not generate damaging shock waves, are described in Chapter 6. The
dispersion models described in this chapter are used to estimate the flammable area of the cloud.
The movement of the ambient air is responsible for the advection and diffusion of a neutrallybuoyant pollutant in all but the very near field. The movement of pollutants with densities
significantly different than the ambient air is also affected by gravity and can loft or hug the ground.
But even for dense gases and dense aerosols, the movement of the ambient air usually dominates
their dispersion.
A chemical vapor cloud is composed of a pollutant chemical and air in a ratio that changes with time
and location. Clouds containing chemicals with high molecular weight, or aerosols, can be
sufficiently dense that gravity has a significant effect on their movements. These dense gas clouds
are modeled differently in ALOHA than clouds that are not directly affected by gravity. ALOHA
incorporates two semi-empirical air dispersion models: the Gaussian model is appropriate for
pollutants clouds that are not directly affected by gravity; the Heavy Gas model is appropriate for
pollutant clouds with densities greater than the ambient air and affected in a significant way by
gravity. These air dispersion models used for neutral and dense pollutant plumes in ALOHA can
account for vertical gradients in wind speed and atmospheric turbulence, but do not account for
topographic steering or winds that vary with time.
The ambient wind usually dominates the advection and diffusion processes for both dense and
neutrally buoyant gas clouds. The movement of air is characterized by its velocity field and
turbulence. The roughness elements of the ground provide a drag on the moving air, producing a
velocity gradient where the speed at the surface itself is zero and increases logarithmically with
height. The surface roughness elements not only affect the vertical wind profile, but also generate
turbulence within the wind field. Topography and large structures also affect the velocity field and
turbulence as the wind moves around and over these features. Turbulence is also generated by
thermal effects; the sun warms the ground which, in turn, warms surface air causing it to rise.
Air Dispersion Models 35
4.2 METHODS FOR CHARACTERIZING WIND FIELDS AND TURBULENCE
Atmospheric turbulence has a major impact on the rate of dispersion of a pollutant cloud. Stability
is a concept used to characterize the property of the low-lying atmosphere that governs the vertical
movement of air. Specifically, stability refers to the tendency of the atmosphere to resist or
enhance vertical motion and thus turbulence. A stable atmosphere inhibits the vertical mixing; a
neutral atmosphere neither enhances nor inhibits vertical mixing; and an unstable atmosphere
enhances vertical mixing and turbulence. Solar radiation plays a large role in atmospheric stability.
With strong solar radiation, the ground warms and warms the low-lying air; the warm air rises
generating eddies and a high level of turbulence. In contrast, when the air temperature increases
with height, buoyancy forces act to inhibit vertical mixing creating a highly stable atmosphere.
Stability classification is a central factor in ALOHA’s air dispersion models.
Pasquill (Pasquill 1961) defined six atmospheric stability classes (now usually called the
Pasquill-Gifford-Turner stability classes). Classes A to F each represent a different degree of
atmospheric turbulence. Stability class D represents a neutral stability condition. Unstable
conditions are associated with atmospheric stability classes A, B, and C, where A is extremely
unstable, B is moderately unstable, and C is slightly unstable. Stability classes E and F represent
increasingly stable atmospheric conditions.
ALOHA can use either of two estimation methods to determine atmospheric stability class,
depending on whether the user enters weather information manually or a portable weather station
transmits readings to it. In addition, ALOHA allows the user to override these methods and directly
specify the stability class.
4.2.1 MANUAL DATA ENTRY OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
When the user manually enters atmospheric data, ALOHA uses a stability class method that
incorporates the Pasquill-Gifford-Turner stability typing scheme. The method was developed using
air dispersion measurements collected during experimental releases conducted during the 1950s
and 1960s. During these experiments, most concentration measurements were made at distances
within 1 kilometer from the release point. Because only in a few instances were concentrations
measured at distances as far as 10 kilometers from the release location, it is not certain whether the
method is reliable at greater distances.
Solar insolation (the solar energy flux) and wind speed are the two factors affecting the choice of
stability class in ALOHA. Table 10 forms the basis for the determination of stability class for plumes
over land in ALOHA. This table is identical to one presented by Turner (Turner 1994) with the
exception that Turner did not assign stability classes for nighttime cases when wind speed is less
than 2 m s-1. According to Turner, strong insolation corresponds to a solar altitude greater than 60°
on a clear day, moderate insolation corresponds to a solar altitude between 60° and 35° on a clear
day, and slight insolation corresponds to a solar altitude between 15° and 35° on a clear day.
Nighttime is considered the time between one hour before sunset to one hour after sunrise.
ALOHA includes solar altitude and cloud cover in its determination of stability class. User-entered
information on date, time, location, and cloud cover are used to determine the solar insolation. If
36 Air Dispersion Models
more than one stability class fits the indicated conditions, ALOHA selects the most stable of these
classes. ALOHA provides the user the option to directly select the stability class.
Table 10. Solar Insolation and stability class table.

<2 A A – B B E F
2 – 3 A – B B C E F
3 – 5 B B – C C D E
5 – 6 C C – D D D D
>6 C D D D D
Stability is D for completely overcast conditions during day or night.
For plumes over water, ALOHA assumes stable conditions regardless of solar insolation or wind
speed.
ALOHA classifies the solar insolation based on the net energy flux to the ground. Solar insolation
greater than 851 W/m2 is considered strong insolation; computed insolation between 851 and 526
W/m2 is considered moderate insolation; and computed insolation between 526 and 176 W/m2 is
considered slight insolation. ALOHA estimates solar insolation absorbed by the ground from the
location, time, and degree of cloudiness (Raphael 1962):

4.2.2 AUTOMATIC WIND DATA ENTRY USING A SAM
ALOHA can be connected to a Station for Atmospheric Measurements (SAM) for direct wind
measurements. Stability class can be derived from the wind speed and measured standard
deviation in the wind direction, σθ ,m , in combination with user-entered surface roughness and
solar radiation. The method used to estimate stability class was described by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (United States. Environmental Protection Agency 1987).
The method is based on the wind speed at 10m, and a Surface Roughness Length, 0 z , equal to 15
cm. If the roughness length is different than 15 cm, the standard deviation in wind angle is adjusted
to
0.2
0

  =     .
An initial estimate of stability class is based on the standard deviation in wind direction measured
at 10 meters.

4.2.3 WIND PROFILE
The air dispersion models used in ALOHA require the vertical wind-speed profile. A steady-state
wind varies significantly with height near the surface. Dispersion in the alongwind direction is
generated mostly by this vertical wind shear. ALOHA uses the entered wind speed and reference
height along with atmospheric stability and ground roughness data to compute a wind profile.
Wind profile formulations are based on the assumption that wind speed and direction, as well as all
other atmospheric conditions, remain horizontally homogeneous and do not change during the
duration of a release.
The wind profile is affected by the irregularities of the solid surface over which the air moves.
Obstacles such as trees, bushes, even blades of grass have an impact on the vertical profile of the
wind. The ALOHA user chooses ground roughness conditions by entering a numerical value for
Air Dispersion Models 39
ground roughness length, 0 z (m), or selecting one of three terrain conditions: Choosing Open
Country sets the surface roughness to 0.03 m, Urban or Forest sets the surface roughness to 1 m,
Open Water sets the surface roughness to a value based on the wind speed at 10 meters, U10 (m s1):
2.5
0 10 z U = 0.0000026 ( )
The dispersions models in ALOHA use surface roughness lengths in a limited fashion. The Gaussian
Model only distinguishes between large and small ground roughness, and the Heavy Gas model uses
a roughness length of 0.10 m for all user-specified roughness lengths greater than 0.10 m.
In parts of the model, ALOHA approximates the wind profile within the surface sublayer using

k is the von Kármán constant, taken to be 0.4,

and Pasquill stability classes A to F, typical values of n are 0.109, 0.112, 0.120, 0.142, 0.203, 0.253.
4.3 GAUSSIAN MODEL FOR NEUTRALLY BUOYANT GASES
ALOHA’s Gaussian dispersion model is intended to be used with vapor clouds that do not
significantly affect the ambient air flow, and are not affected by gravity; they are considered passive
pollutants.
The Gaussian model predicts that the concentration distribution of a steady-state release of
neutrally buoyant gas will approach a Gaussian distribution with increasing down-wind distance.
The parameters characterizing the distribution are based on empirical measurements. Increasing
averaging times of the measurements also tend to drive the distribution to a Gaussian shape, as well
as widen the spatial distribution. The actual concentration distribution from a release can vary
significantly from Gaussian at any single instant in time.
The method used in ALOHA accommodates instantaneous, continuous, and time-dependent
releases of finite duration up to one hour. An instantaneous release is modeled as a single oneminute steady-state release which gives rise to a single cloud. A continuous release is modeled as a
single one-hour steady-state release which gives rise to a single cloud.
Air Dispersion Models 41
A time-dependent release is modeled as series of five finite-duration steady-state releases; each
giving rise to a cloud that does not interact with the other clouds. The concentration at a point in
space and time is found by summing the contributions from each cloud.
The model used to describe the dispersion of each cloud is based on a Gaussian dispersion model
developed by Palazzi (Palazzi et al. 1982) that describes the behavior of steady state releases of
short duration. This model is described as

The presence of an inversion can have a significant effect on the vertical diffusion of the cloud.
When a layer of unstable air at the ground lies beneath a layer of stable air, the interface acts to
contain the pollutant cloud. The effect of an inversion can be quite complex and simplifications
42 Air Dispersion Models
were required in ALOHA. As a conservative approximation, ALOHA models the interface between
the stable and unstable air as impervious to the transport of the pollutant. The ground and the
inversion act as a pair of reflecting surfaces for the pollutant cloud. Note that ALOHA only
accommodates situations where the inversion height, i h , is above the height of the release, s h . The

Far downwind, the repeated reflections of the cloud tend to produce a uniform concentration
beneath the inversion. ALOHA approximates the vertical distribution as homogenous at distances
downwind such that ( ) z i σ ≥ 2hx .
4.3.1 DETERMINATION OF DISPERSION PARAMETERS
The concentration distribution described above is a Gaussian distribution parameterized by three
empirical dispersion parameters. These are the standard deviations of the Gaussian distribution:
.,, yx z and σσσ The dispersion parameters depend upon the stability class, and in some cases the
surface roughness. They also depend upon the averaging times associated with their measurement.
Briggs developed formulas for estimating σ y and σ z for each of the Pasquill-Gifford-Turner
stability classes, and for Urban (large surface roughness) and Rural (small surface roughness)
conditions (Briggs 1973, Hanna et al. 1982):

The values of the parameters are presented as a function of atmospheric stability and roughness in

Air Dispersion Models 43
Briggs analysis employed only two surface roughness classifications: Urban corresponds to large
ground roughness, or Rural which corresponds to small surface roughness. If the user-specified
ground roughness is less than 20 cm, Rural is selected, otherwise Urban is selected.
Averaging times varied for the experiments used to determine dispersion parameters; however,
Briggs did not adjust the coefficients used to estimate σ y to account for the different averaging
times associated with the data sets from which they were derived (Blewitt 1990). The rural
coefficients were derived from data averaged over 3 minutes, and the urban coefficients were
derived from data averaged over 1 hour. When the coefficients are corrected for this difference, the
formulas produce similar curves (Blewitt 1990). For this reason, ALOHA uses only the rural
coefficients based on 3-minute averaging times to estimate σ y under all surface roughness
conditions.
To estimate σ z , Briggs derived a set of analytical solutions from two different experiments. Data
used for values of σ z greater than 100 m relfect a 1-hour averaging time, while data used for
smaller values of the σ z reflect averaging times of 10 to 15 minutes (Briggs 1991). There is no
definitive averaging time associated with this parameter, and we do not expect σ z to be strongly
dependence on averaging time.
To estimate σ x , the standard deviation function in the alongwind direction, ALOHA uses the
following formula, which is based on Beals (Beals 1971) and is also used in the heavy gas model
DEGADIS (Havens and Spicer 1985). Beals made no reference to the associated averaging times for
σ x , and we do not expect σ x to be strongly dependent on averaging time. The formula is shown as

4.4 HEAVY GAS MODEL FOR DENSE GASES
The Heavy Gas dispersion calculations used in ALOHA are based on the DEGADIS model (Havens
and Spicer 1985, Spicer and Havens 1989). DEGADIS, in turn, is an adaptation of the Shell HEGADIS
model described by Colenbrander (Colenbrander 1980, Colenbrander and Puttock 1983); DEGADIS
also incorporates some techniques used by van Ulden (van Ulden 1974, 1983). DEGADIS was
selected as the basis for ALOHA’s dense gas computations because of its general acceptance and the
extensive testing that was carried out by its authors.
Some simplifications were introduced into ALOHA-DEGADIS, making it different from the DEGADIS
model. ALOHA-DEGADIS is limited to releases at ground level, and does not account for the initial
momentum from a jet release. Some of the numerical methods used in ALOHA-DEGADIS have been
simplified compared to those used in DEGADIS. The ambient air pressure used in ALOHA is
independent of position and time. The pollutant and air are assumed to behave as non-interacting
ideal gases.
The method for handling releases that vary with time is unique to ALOHA. DEGADIS is designed to
model steady-state releases, while ALOHA is designed to model time-dependent releases. The
ALOHA-DEGADIS model is essentially the DEGADIS steady-state plume model that has been
adapted to handle time-varying sources. For any non-instantaneous sources in ALOHA, the model
generates a five-step release; each step is a finite-duration steady-state release. The Heavy Gas
model generates infinite-duration steady-state plumes for each of these sources. A composite timevarying cloud is created by adding together pieces of the five steady-state plumes. The pieces start
Air Dispersion Models 45
as steady-state plumes ten meters in length. Each piece is converted into a Gaussian in the
downwind direction, conserving mass, but maintaining its vertical and horizontal dimensions. The
pieces are summed to create the time-varying cloud. The Guassian dispersion parameter used, σ x ,
is the same as that used in the Gaussian dispersion model (Beals 1971).
ALOHA-DEGADIS has beenverified by comparisons to field experiments, the original DEGADIS
model, and other reference models. As part of the verification process, the authors of both models
reviewed each model's code and computations line by line (Havens 1990).
Estimates made by ALOHA-DEGADIS and DEGADIS for a series of release scenarios were also
compared. Using a fractional factorial experimental design (Cochran and Cox 1957), a set of 24 test
scenarios was prepared. Eight DEGADIS input variables—stability class, wind speed, spill size,
release duration, gas density, ground roughness, chemical-ground temperature difference, the
coefficients of the equation of state, and level of concern—were varied in the 24 scenarios in order
to span the expected variability within model parameters. We believe that these factors are the
most important influences on concentration estimates made by DEGADIS.
For the 24 cases, the correlation between the estimates of concentration and downwind distance
made by the two models was 0.997. For steady-state, continuous release cases, ALOHA-DEGADIS
tended to predict a longer distance than was predicted by the full DEGADIS model. ALOHADEGADIS threat zones averaged 10% longer than those predicted by DEGADIS. For short-term
releases, the arrival time of the peak concentration at a given location downwind and the maximum
value of the peak were also examined. Arrival times predicted by ALOHA-DEGADIS were slightly
later than those predicted by DEGADIS, although the correlation between estimates made by each
model was 1.0. ALOHA-DEGADIS predicted downwind movement of gas clouds to average about
9% slower than the travel rate predicted by DEGADIS. ALOHA-DEGADIS predicted maximum
concentrations that exceeded DEGADIS estimates by an average of 8%. The correlation between
maximum concentration estimates made by the two models was 0.994%.
These results demonstrate that the ALOHA-DEGADIS model is consistently slightly more
conservative than DEGADIS. It can be expected to produce peak concentration estimates for a given
point that are, on average, about 10% greater than estimates made by the full DEGADIS model.
4.4.1 CRITERIA FOR USE OF THE HEAVY GAS MODEL
The ALOHA Heavy Gas model is designed to account for the gravitational effects on pollutant clouds
with densities significantly different than air. Gravitational effects can be insignificant for dense
pollutants if the dispersion is dominated by the wind or thermal convection in the atmosphere, or
the evaporative flux from a pool is small. The Heavy Gas model can still be used with these clouds,
but the Gaussian Model is preferred. The Gaussian model is also recommended when the pollutant
cloud is less dense than air.
In its default mode, ALOHA incorporates a decision algorithm to choose between the Heavy Gas and
Gaussian models. ALOHA uses the critical Richardson's Number (also called the friction
Richardson’s Number), Ric, as the criterion for distinguishing between passive or non-passive
dispersion. When Ric is less than 1, ALOHA considers the gas to be passive and, unless the user
46 Air Dispersion Models
overrides this decision, ALOHA computes dispersion using the Gaussian dispersion model (Spicer
and Havens 1989).
The critical Richardson number depends upon the density of the pollutant, the wind speed, and the
release rate,

4.4.2 CONCEPTUAL MODEL
Havens and Spicer (Havens and Spicer 1985) described three stages in a heavy gas release. This is
the conceptual model used in DEGADIS and ALOHA-DEGADIS.
1. Buoyancy-Dominated Dispersion. Near the point of a release, buoyancy forces, inertial
forces, and ambient air motions all affect cloud development. Immediately after it is released, a
heavy cloud “slumps” over the ground. The rapidly spreading cloud forces itself under the ambient
atmospheric boundary layer. As it does so, shear at the ground and at the top of the cloud creates a
vortex ring at the forward edge of the cloud (Britter 1989). During this initial spreading, the cloud
entrains approximately 10 times its original mass of ambient air. That is, the density ratio is
reduced by a factor of 10. By the end of this stage, a thin blanket of gas has formed. The blanket
constitutes the secondary source.
The buoyancy-dominated stage evolves through three overlapping sub-stages:
(i) During the slumping phase, which lasts only a few seconds, strong, buoyancy-dependent
spreading forces are balanced by counterflow of the ambient fluid.
(ii) During the buoyancy-inertial phase, buoyancy spreading forces are balanced by inertial
forces. Concentrations within the cloud are greatly diluted as the spreading “head” of the
cloud entrains ambient fluid.
(iii) During the viscous phase, buoyancy forces are balanced by viscous forces. Turbulent
mixing is suppressed, and the dilution rate slows.
2. Stably Stratified Shear Flow. In this region, buoyancy forces and ambient air flow determine
the cloud development, acting to produce a stably stratified cloud embedded in the mean wind flow.
The cloud remains thin and spreads laterally as it is advected downwind. The stable density profile
in the cloud suppresses turbulence, and turbulent fluctuations in the cloud are characteristically
below-ambient levels. Air is entrained into the spreading cloud primarily through its top as well as
along its edges.
3. Passive Turbulent Dispersion. The cloud continues to be diluted until its density only
slightly exceeds the density of the air. The small remaining density difference only negligibly
affects cloud dispersion, and natural levels of turbulence return. The gas becomes a passive
contaminant.
4.4.3 SECONDARY SOURCE IN ALOHA
ALOHA does not explicitly model the buoyancy-dominated dispersion that leads to the formation of
a heavy gas blanket, also called the Secondary Source. Instead, it uses a simplified method to
estimate the blanket dimensions.
Four source types are described in Chapter 2: direct release, tank release, pipeline release, and
evaporating puddle. For heavy gas modeling, these are referred to as the Primary Sources. The
Primary Source is generally time dependent and approximated as a series of five finite-duration
steady-state sources.
48 Air Dispersion Models
The heavy gas model is fundamentally a steady-state plume model, while the Primary Sources are
generally time-dependent. To approximate the time-dependence of the plume, ALOHA generates
steady-state plumes based on the five time steps of the Primary Source, treating each as a timeindependent steady-state source. Time dependence is later introduced by combining the timeindependent plumes.
The buoyancy-dominated stage of a heavy gas release generates a “blanket” of dense gas which is
centered on the location of the Primary Source and does not move with the ambient air flow. The
Primary Source feeds this blanket at a constant rate, while the uptake and transport of gas from the
top of the blanket removes gas from the blanket. The atmospheric uptake rate is proportional to
the area of the blanket, so the blanket reaches its steady-state size when the atmospheric uptake
rate equals the Primary Source. The blanket is assumed to be circular.
Most of the Primary Sources in ALOHA are point sources; however, the evaporating puddle has a
defined area. If the area of the evaporating puddle is greater than the steady-state area of the heavy
gas blanket, the area of the blanket is set equal to the puddle area.
The total mass of the developing blanket is

4.4.4 STABLY STRATIFIED SHEAR FLOW AND PASSIVE DIFFUSION STAGES
The heavy gas dispersion model in DEGADIS is almost identical to the similarity model proposed by
Colenbrander (Colenbrander 1980).
Air flow over the blanket creates a plume of heavy gas. To simplify computation, the cylindrical
blanket is treated as a square prism of equal volume and height. The plume is assumed to be
composed of (i) a horizontally homogeneous core of width 2b that has vertical dispersion, and (ii)
Gaussian-shaped edges. As the plume transitions from stably stratified shear flow to passive
turbulent diffusion, the width of the homogeneous core goes to zero. The following equation for the
concentration of the pollutant is applicable to both regions:

Four variables are functions of x and must be computed for each downwind step:
( ) c c x is the centerline ground-level concentration (ppm),
( ) y S x is the lateral dispersion parameter (m),
( ) z S x is the vertical dispersion parameter (m), and
b is the half-width of the homogeneous core section (m).
The dispersion parameters are based on measurements. We do not expect the vertical dispersion
parameter to be strongly dependent on the averaging times used in its measurement. However, the
horizontal dispersion does have a dependence on averaging time; it is thought to scale with the
averaging time raised to the 0.2 power. ALOHA-DEGADIS adjusts the horizontal dispersion
parameter to correspond to an averaging time of 5 minutes for toxic clouds, and 10 seconds for
flammable clouds.
Air Dispersion Models 51
In the discussion to follow, a coupled set of empirical parametric equations will be presented. This
set of equations must be solved simultaneously at each step in the x direction.

The steady-plumes generated by the Heavy Gas model are combined to create a time-dependent
cloud, as described in the General Comments section above.
4.5 THREAT ZONE
ALOHA’s threat zone represents the area within which the ground-level gas concentration exceeds
the level of concern at any time.
4.5.1 ESTIMATING MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION
The concentration of the pollutant is a function of both location and time. In order to generate a
threat zone, ALOHA calculates the peak concentration as a function of time for all points in space. It
is important to note that this is not a true peak in the concentration since the concentrations
predicted by ALOHA are time-averaged over different time intervals, depending upon the
dispersion model employed. Implicit averaging times within the dispersion models vary.
The maximum concentration function M(x,y) for any point (x,y) is defined to be the maximum over
all time of concentration at that point, and is given by
( ) ( ) , max , , t
M xy C xyt −∞≤ ≤∞
=    .
ALOHA implements this function as follows. First, it identifies the source step associated with the
highest release rate, and finds tm (s), the time corresponding to the midpoint of that source step. It
then finds t0 (s), the time at which the cloud associated with that source step is centered at the point
(x,0) as
0 m
x
t t
u
= + .
ALOHA initially guesses the maximum concentration at (x,y) to be C(x,y,t0). To test this, it compares
the value of C(x,y,t0) to C(x,y,t0±30). If one of these values is larger, it compares concentrations in
that direction using 30-second intervals for as long as concentration continues to increase.
4.5.2 DRAWING THE THREAT ZONE
The threat zone contour runs through points where the maximum concentration equals the LOC. At
points within the threat zone, the maximum concentration function exceeds the LOC.
56 Air Dispersion Models
ALOHA constructs the threat zone contour in two steps. First, it performs a binary search of the
maximum concentration function to find xl, the downwind distance to the LOC (m). For a puddle
source, ALOHA performs a second binary search to find the off-axis distances to the LOC from nine
points equally spaced along the x-axis at distances 0, xl/8, 2xl/8, 3xl/8...xl. In the cases of point
sources, ALOHA finds these off-axis distances using
( )

    =        
where x is the distance of each of the nine points along the x-axis. The threat zone contour runs
through each of the (x,y) points found by this method. ALOHA uses a Bezier fit to connect these
points by smooth curves.
4.5.3 CONFIDENCE CONTOURS
Uncertainties in the average wind direction are represented on the threat zone graph as confidence
lines. The axis of the threat zone is rotated through an angle on either side of the nominal wind
direction and the contour of the rotated threat zone is drawn. The angle, α , is based on the width
of the Guassian plume at a distance 5 minutes downwind of the source,

where U3 is the wind speed at 3 meters (m s-1).
4.6 INDOOR AIR CONCENTRATION
It is generally recognized that a well-insulated house or building provides excellent protection
against a toxic cloud of finite time duration (Wilson 1987). Assuming the infiltration rate is small
and that the air inside is always well-mixed, the building acts like a low-pass filter and an electrical
R-C filtering circuit offers an excellent analog.
The infiltration time constant is the time required after a step-increase in the outside concentration
of a gas for the concentration inside to reach 63% of the step difference. This number can vary
from 1 to 0.1 hours depending on the building tightness, the wind, and the inside-outside
temperature difference. The wind blowing against a building creates pressure differences and
these drive infiltration and exfiltration depending on the direction of the pressure gradient.
Temperature differences create a pressure gradient and thus enhance the infiltration process.
Because of the extreme variability in weather and building types, ALOHA must make some broad
generalizations. Sherman (Sherman 1980, Sherman, Wilson, and Keil 1984) studied 196 houses and
found that an effective leakage area is 0.00059 times the area of the house. ALOHA uses this figure
and assigns an average house floor area of 160 m2 (1722 ft2). An average building ceiling height of
Air Dispersion Models 57
2.5 m is taken for a single-story house and 5m is used for a two-story building. A reasonable
approximation of inside temperature is 20°C. It is assumed that all leakage occurs evenly over the
structure and that there is no difference between floor and ceiling leakage.
We assume that the outside and inside concentrations are uniform and that environmental
conditions are stationary in time. The balance of inflow and outflow of the chemical is

The infiltration time constant can be specified by the user during setup. If not specified, it is
approximated using a method based on the work of Sherman (Sherman 1980). The infiltration time
constant is assumed to be proportional to the square root of the pressure differential between
inside and outside, which in turn are dependent upon wind loading and temperature differences
(stack effect). The infiltration time constant is

5 MODELS FOR CALCULATING BLAST EFFECTS FROM VAPOR CLOUD
EXPLOSIONS
5.1 BACKGROUND
As an airborne chemical travels downwind, it mixes with air. A cloud containing a flammable
chemical within its flammability limits can ignite if it encounters a spark, flame, or other ignition
source. The combustion reaction can propagate away from the source by one of two mechanisms:
Deflagration reactions propagate by means of diffusion of reactive species through the cloud.
Detonation reactions propagate through a reactive fuel-air mixture by means of a pressure wave
that travels at the local speed of sound. Deflagrations propagate more slowly than detonations;
however, in either case, the reaction can cause temperatures and pressures within the cloud to
increase dramatically. Both detonations and deflagrations can generate pressure waves with sharp
onsets and significant overpressures; a pressure wave capable of causing damage to individuals or
structures is called a blast wave in ALOHA.
Most vapor cloud combustions are deflagrations that propagate slowly and do not produce blast
waves; these are usually referred to as flash fires. For some highly reactive chemicals, the flame
speed (the propagation speed) within part of the cloud is accelerated by turbulence caused by
obstacles or confinement resulting in a fast deflagration or transition to detonation; either is
referred to as an explosion. These events can generate blast waves; usually only a small part of the
flammable cloud is involved, so the blast effects are limited. In rare events, a high-power triggering
event such as condensed-phase explosive or confined vapor cloud explosion can set off the
detonation of the entire flammable cloud. The American Institute for Chemical Engineers
(American Institute of Chemical Engineers 1994) estimates that direct initiation of detonation
requires approximately one million Joules. The blast wave from the detonation of a large
flammable cloud can have far-reaching effects; they can extend well beyond the area affected by the
thermal radiation.
Damage is associated with both the shape and magnitude of the blast wave; both change as the
wave travels outward from the reacting cloud. Peak overpressure and impulse are commonly used
to characterize the blast wave. Wiekema reports a correlation between lung damage and the
combination of overpressure and impulse (Wiekema 1984). Most studies of condensed phase
explosions correlate injury with overpressure only. Clancey explained that the relationship
between overpressure and impulse for condensed phase explosions is unique, so a single parameter
is sufficient to describe the blast wave (Institution of Chemical Engineers (Great Britain). North
Western Branch. 1982). Injuries and damage to structures from vapor cloud explosions depend on
both overpressure and impulse; however, as with condensed phase explosions, most correlations
use overpressure only. This simplification seems to be driven by the lack of data rather than any
unique relationship between overpressure and impulse for vapor cloud explosions.
ALOHA uses only peak pressure to characterize the damaging effects associated with a blast wave.
Harm can be due to direct effects or indirect effects of the pressure wave. Direct effects include
damage to pressure-sensitive organs like ear and lung. Indirect effects can result from glass
fragments from broken windows, collapse of buildings, or debris that is accelerated by the blast
60 Models for Calculating Blast Effects from Vapor Cloud Explosions
wave. ALOHA includes three LOCs that quantify indirect and direct effects. Glass windows can
shatter at 1 psi over ambient; at 3.5 psi there is a significant risk of eardrum rupture and injuries of
serious nature from flying debris; at 8 psi there is significant risk of ear and lung damage and
indirect effects from the collapse of unreinforced buildings (Baker 1983).
5.2 METHOD
ALOHA only models combustion reactions. ALOHA estimates the blast wave from unconfined vapor
cloud explosions (fast deflagrations and detonations). Unconfined means that the cloud is not
entirely or partially bounded by solid walls or ceilings. Confined vapor cloud explosions generally
produce more damaging blast waves than unconfined or partially confined explosions.
The Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) model is the basis for the ALOHA overpressure calculation
(Pierorazio et al. 2005); it uses non-dimensional, empirically derived blast curves to predict
overpressure. The overpressure is based on the propagation speed of the flame front and the mass
of fuel involved in the reaction. The basic principle of this method is that within the vapor cloud
there are regions where physical structures can cause an acceleration of the flame front. These
areas are characterized by the structure density using a parameter termed congestion. Flame
speed is related to the chemical properties of the fuel, the level of congestion, and the nature of the
ignition source.

detonation transition (DDT).

A reactivity term is used to characterize the chemical properties of the fuel. Reactivity ratings used
by Zeeuwen and Wiekema (Zeeuwen and Wiekema 1978) classify reactivity based upon chemical
laminar burning velocity in the BST model (Woodward 1998). Low-reactivity chemicals have
velocities less than 45 cm/sec. High reactivity applies to those chemicals with burn velocities
greater than 75 cm/sec and anything in between is labeled medium reactivity. Some chemicals in
the ALOHA database were classified using this criteria; however, most of the flammable chemicals
in ALOHA have not been classified. In these cases, ALOHA uses medium reactivity, since few
chemicals have a laminar burning speeds exceeding 75 cm/sec.
A congestion parameter is used to quantify the way small structures within the vapor cloud affect
the flame speed. Congestion refers to the density of obstacles that generate turbulence. Obstacles
of this nature are generally small, like a shrub, and do not impede the flame front. Larger objects,
like a building, can impede the flame front, so they should not be considered obstacles for the
Models for Calculating Blast Effects from Vapor Cloud Explosions 61
purposes of congestion. Greater turbulence allows the flame front to accelerate, thereby generating
a more powerful blast wave. The experiments that form the basis for the BST model found the
flame speed could be related to area blockage ratio (cross sectional area of the structures divided
by area of the cloud) and pitch (distance between rows of structures). The experiments used small
structures arranged in regular patterns. Three levels of congestion could be distinguished: low
congestion with an area blockage ratios less than 10%; medium congestion with area blockage ratio
between 10% and 40%; and high congestion with higher blockage ratios. Extrapolating the
laboratory parameters to what is found in an accidental explosion is highly imprecise so ALOHA
greatly simplifies the use of congestion. Guidance in ALOHA requires the user to determine
whether significant congestion is present. A congested zone is defined as one with so many closely
spaced obstacles that it is difficult or impossible to walk through it; for example, pipe racks in
industrial facilities and some forested areas where the trees and branches are closely spaced may
be characterized as congested zones. To err on the side of caution, congestion defined this way is
correlated with the high-congestion flame speed in the BST model.
The source of ignition also affects the flame speed. In ALOHA, the user inputs the ignition source. If
the source is designated as a detonation, the model assumes that the triggering event is of sufficient
power to cause the entire reactive cloud to detonate.
ALOHA’s method for finding the normalized overpressure as a function of distance from the center
of the explosive cloud is based on a set of empirically determined graphs (Pierorazio et al. 2005).
BST reported normalized overpressure versus normalized distance from the center of the
congested region with a different graph for different flame speeds. To implement these in ALOHA,
the graphical data reported by BST were fit to functions of the form

The energy contributing to the blast wave is
E ref H Mass = ⋅⋅ c ,
where
ref is a ground reflection factor,
Hc is the heat of combustion of the fuel, and
Mass is the mass of fuel involved in the explosion.
The ground reflection factor is set to 2 in ALOHA, consistent with the treatment by BST. It accounts
for the reflection of the blast wave off the ground. ALOHA’s treatment is based on a simplified
conceptual model of the explosive cloud. The cloud is treated as a hemisphere at ground level with
a uniform concentration. Elevated clouds would have a smaller reflection factor.
The most significant difference between the method in ALOHA and the Baker-Strehlow-Tang model
is the method for determining the mass of fuel in the explosion. In the BST method, areas of
congestion within a flammable cloud define the mass of fuel contributing to an explosion. The
flame front propagates from the point of ignition, accelerates within regions of congestion, and
decelerates outside the region of congestion. Only the mass of the fuel within a congested area
contributes to the explosion. A flammable cloud emanating from a single release may give rise to as
many explosions as there are distinct congested areas. The flame speeds are defined by the levels
of congestion within those regions. Outside the congested areas the flame speed is assumed to be
so slow that no significant overpressure is generated.
ALOHA uses a different approach for determining the mass of fuel involved in the explosion based
on the recommendations of the American Institute for Chemical Engineers (American Institute of
Chemical Engineers 1994). AIChE suggests that the BST blast curves can be coupled with an air
dispersion model for determining the mass of the explosive cloud, using all the fuel within
flammable limits times an efficiency factor. An efficiency factor of 5% to 20% is recommended;
ALOHA uses 20%. ALOHA deviates slightly from the AIChE recommendation by using the fuel
within a concentration range between the upper explosive limit and 90% of the lower explosive
limit. This minor variation was introduced in ALOHA to create another conservative bias in the
hazard zone calculation; it was not based on standard practices, theory, or measurement. Gas
concentrations above the upper limit are presumed to be too rich, and those below the lower limit
too lean, to participate in the explosion. The explosion of the flammable cloud is approximated as a
single uniform event; the flame speed is based on the average level of congestion within the cloud.
If the explosion is triggered by a high-power source, termed a hard ignition in ALOHA, or the
Models for Calculating Blast Effects from Vapor Cloud Explosions 63
average level of congestion indicates a transition to detonation, 100% of the mass of the flammable
cloud is used and Mach 5.2 is used for the flame speed.
The center of the explosive cloud is equated with the center of mass of flammable cloud in ALOHA.
For non-steady-state releases the location of the center and mass of the flammable cloud changes
with time. Users may choose the time of ignition; ALOHA then finds the flammable mass and center
of the cloud, and generates overpressures as a function of distance. ALOHA can also compute all
possible explosions from a single release and show the composite overpressure threat zone if the
ignition time is not specified.
64 Models for Calculating Blast Effects from Vapor Cloud Explosions
6 THERMAL RADIATION AND FLAMMABLE AREA MODELS
6.1 BACKGROUND
ALOHA models flame hazards associated with some common scenarios involving the combustion of
liquids and gases. Fire scenarios involving chemicals with flashpoints exceeding 300°F cannot be
modeled using ALOHA. Combustion scenarios are divided into two types in ALOHA: those that
involve a fuel mixed with air to form a cloud with concentrations within the flammability range, and
those involving an overly-rich core of fuel that burns at its outer edges (this includes pool fires
where the rich core is the pool itself). ALOHA uses different methods for estimating the threat
zones for these two types of scenarios.
Fires that burn on the surface of a rich core can burn for a long time. The hazard from thermal
(infrared) radiation can extend well beyond the boundaries of the fire itself. Three models in
ALOHA deal with these types of fires: Fireballs occur when a tank containing a flammable liquid
explodes due to overpressurization and immediately ignites, commonly referred to as a BLEVE (the
fire occurs at the surface of the fireball); Jet Fires occur when a flammable gas escapes from a pipe
or tank (the fire occurs at the exit and burns at the edges of the rich core); and Pool Fires occur
when a flammable liquid in a pool ignites and burns directly over the pool. There are two common
empirical modeling approaches for these types of fires: point source models in which some fraction
of the combustion energy is converted to thermal radiation and radiates from the center of the fire,
and solid flame models in which the size and shape of the flame surface is found and radiation
emitted from its surface are computed.
ALOHA employs solid flame models to compute thermal radiation hazards from fireballs, jet fires,
and pool fires. In these three scenarios, the flux of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of the
flame is computed, and the radiation impinging upon a distant target is found using
q EF =⋅⋅τ ,
where
q is the thermal radiation flux incident on a vertical surface (W m-2),
E is the thermal radiation energy flux at the surface of the fireball (W m-2),
F is the geometric view factor, and
τ is the transmissivity of the atmosphere to thermal radiation.
Fuels that have been mixed with air before ignition burn quickly; the duration of the fire and the
duration of the generated thermal radiation is generally quite short. Since the effects of thermal
radiation scale with duration, the damaging effects usually do not extend very far beyond the
boundaries of the flame itself. ALOHA address the hazard associated with fires that occur when a
vapor cloud disperses downwind and forms a flammable mixture with air, ignites, and burns
through the cloud by modeling the flammable area. ALOHA does not explicitly model the thermal
radiation associated with flash fires.
Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models 65
6.2 LEVELS OF CONCERN FOR THERMAL RADIATION
The effects of thermal radiation are a function of the energy flux and the duration of exposure. For
fires with expected durations exceeding about 30 seconds, the LOC is based upon the thermal
radiation generated by the flame. Eisenberg analyzed data from nuclear weapons tests to
determine the relationship between the intensity of thermal radiation and the probability that an
exposed individual would be injured or killed (Eisenberg, Lynch, and Breeding 1975). He reported
that the probability of a fatality is generally proportional to the duration of exposure (td) times the
incident radiation flux (I) raised to the 4/3 power. For non-lethal effects, a power law of 1.15 fits
the data better. The threshold for first degree burns was found when the exposure (in the form I1.15
td) is 550,000 (W/m2)1.15 sec. Mudan reviewed Eisenberg's work as well as other studies that dealt
with radiation sources that are less intense, but have longer duration (National Fire Protection
Association 1995). The exposure laws described by Eisenberg obviously fail for very low, longlived radiation sources; Mudan reports that an incident flux of 1.7 kW/m2 will not even cause pain,
regardless of exposure time. The apparent breakdown of the exposure law reported by Eisenberg
is also reflected in the Safety Standards for Liquid Natural Gas Facilities in Title 49 of the Code of
Federal Regulations. In calculating the radiation effects of pool fires, long-lived events, the Title 49
states that the radiation flux in an area of public assembly should be less than 5kW/m2, regardless
of exposure time (United States Office of the Federal Register).
Burning pools, jets, and fireballs associated with a BLEVE can burn with sufficient longevity to
create a persistent thermal radiation source that can cause harm far from the flame front itself. The
impact on people depends on the both the duration of exposure and the intensity of the radiation.
ALOHA computes the energy flux associated with the radiation as a function of distance and the
duration of the fire and reports them separately. Even though dose values are associated with
damage, energy flux values are used as LOCs in ALOHA since exposure time is a function of both the
duration of the fire and the movement of individuals seeking some protection. ALOHA’s LOCs are
consistent with the recommendations of Mudan and Croce (National Fire Protection Association
1995): 10kW/m2 is a fatality threshold; 5kW/m2 can cause second degree burns on unprotected
skin; and 2kW/m2 can cause pain. ALOHA refers to exposure durations of 60 seconds or less for
these effects. The duration of the fire is included in the text summary screen of the ALOHA output
allowing the user to adjust the flux levels to conform to the fire duration time.
6.3 BLEVE-FIREBALL
The BLEVE-Fireball model in ALOHA is a solid flame model based on studies of fireballs resulting
from BLEVEs (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions) involving flammable gases liquefied
under pressure and stored at ambient temperatures, such as LPG (American Institute of Chemical
Engineers 1994). In a common course of events, a fire impinges upon the tank, thermally stressing
the tank and causing the internal pressure to rise. Pressure relief valves fail to adequately relieve
the pressure and the tank explodes from the combination of heat and pressure. The contents are
almost instantaneously released and quickly flash boil as they experience a drop in pressure. Much
of the fuel, both liquid droplets and gas, is thrown into the air and ignites. The bulk of the burning
mass is too rich to burn, but the fire burns at the surface where sufficient air can mix with the fuel.
The resulting fireball burns for tens of seconds and often lifts into the air.
66 Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models
For a BLEVE scenario ALOHA assumes a near-instantaneous rupture and defaults to an assumption
that the entire contents of a tank contribute to the fireball. However, in cases where the initial tank
pressure is relatively low the user has an option of specifying the fraction of the contents that
become part of the fireball. Based on the mass of fireball, the maximum diameter of the fireball is
computed, approximating the fireball as a spherical object with its surface just touching the ground.
(The fireball’s diameter is a function of time; the maximum diameter is used in ALOHA to insure
that hazard zones are not underestimated.) The flux of thermal radiation emitted from the burning
surface is computed, and the radiation impinging upon a distant target is found. When the user
specifies that less than 100% of the contents of the tank are in the fireball ALOHA assumes the
remaining fuel forms a pool fire, and the pool fire model is used to find an alternate threat zone for
thermal radiation. A limit of 5000 metric tons is employed as the maximum amount of chemical
that can be modeled. This limit is of the order of the largest historical single BLEVE incident.
Though the probability of explosive rupture and fireball production is much lower for nonpressurized tanks, ALOHA extends the BLEVE-Fireball model to gases liquefied by refrigeration and
volatile liquids with flash points below 300°F. Explosions of tanks containing pressurized gases can
also generate fireballs of comparable size and duration (Zalosh and Weyandt 2005). However,
ALOHA does not allow users to model the thermal radiation from fireballs associated with
pressurized gases.
6.3.1 EMISSIVITY
AIChE states that 350 kW/m2 is a reasonable emissive energy flux for large fireballs involving
hydrocarbon fuels (American Institute of Chemical Engineers 1994). ALOHA applies this to a
broader range of chemicals and sizes, but adjusts this value by multiplying by the ratio of the heat
of combustion of the chemical divided by the heat of combustion of propane, and described as

where
∆hc is the heat of combustion of the chemical (J kg-1), and

Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models 67
6.3.2 VIEW FACTOR
The geometric view factor is a function of the size of the fireball and distance between a receptor
and the fireball. The size depends upon the amount of the fuel contributing to the fireball. The user
may choose to let ALOHA use the entire contents of the tank as the mass of the fireball, or have
ALOHA calculate the fraction of the tank contents that contribute to the fireball based on the
pressure or temperature of the tank at the time of rupture. If tank pressure is specified, the
temperature at the time of rupture, T , is found using the Clausius-Clayperon equation, based on
the assumption that two phases are present at equilibrium in the vessel, and described as

An empirical correlation indicates that mass of chemical participating in the fireball is about three
times the mass of fuel that flash boils upon rupture, limited to the total mass of the contents of the
tank (Hasegawa and Sato 1977).
ALOHA adopted the recommendation of Roberts for computing the diameter of a fireball (Roberts
1982):

the fireball.
6.3.3 TRANSMISSIVITY
The transmissivity of the atmosphere to thermal radiation, τ , depends upon the distance between
the emitting and receiving surfaces, x . It is sensitive to fog, rain, smoke, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor in the atmosphere. ALOHA only accounts for water vapor. By neglecting the other factors,
ALOHA overestimates the transmitted radiation in cases where the other attenuating phenomena
occur. Transmissivity of the atmosphere to thermal radiation, τ , is well studied. ALOHA uses the
formula reported by Cook et al. (Cook, Bahrami, and Whitehouse 1990),
10 1.389 0.135log ( ) P xw τ = − .
ALOHA uses the formula reported by Thibodeaux for the partial pressure of water in the

6.4 JET FIRES
The jet fire analysis in ALOHA is designed to address the thermal radiation hazards associated with
gases and aerosols released from pressurized tanks and pipes which ignite before the vapors
disperse downwind. Jet fires differ from flash fires in that they completely burn immediately upon
release at the surface of a fuel-rich core. Jet fires differ from fireballs in that jet fires are associated
with sustained releases, while fireballs are associated with an explosive tank rupture due to
overpressurization.
The Jet Fire model in ALOHA can be applied to an upward vertical jet release: a pipe oriented
vertically or a hole at the top of a tank. The method in ALOHA is based on an empirical solid flame
model developed by Shell Research (Chamberlain 1987). Fuel released from the pipe or tank
expands, mixes with air, and burns on its surface emitting intense thermal radiation that
propagates outward. The thermal energy incident upon a distant target is a product of the
emissivity of the flame surface, the geometric view factor, and the transmissivity of the atmosphere
to thermal radiation.

0.21 exp( 0.00323 ) 0.11 rad MW j fC u = −+ .
Where CMW is a correction factor introduced by Cook et al (Cook, Bahrami, and Whitehouse 1990)
equal to unity if the molecular weight is less than 21 g mole-1, the square root of the molecular
weight divided by 21 if the molecular weight is between 21 g mole-1 and 60 g mole-1, and equal to

These formulas were modified slightly for the pipeline jet fire and two-phase release scenarios.
ALOHA assumes that the gas expands adiabatically in the last 200 pipe diameters in the pipeline
release. It exits at atmospheric pressure and therefore the effective source diameter, Ds for the
choked option reduces to that for the unchocked option given earlier. For two-phase release,
ALOHA uses a modification of the formula in Cook et al. (Cook, Bahrami, and Whitehouse 1990),

For a tilted jet, Kalghatgi (Kalghatgi 1983) showed in laboratory experiments that the flame length
reduces as the jet is tilted into the wind. Chamberlain uses Kalghatgi’s empirical fit equation to
determine the flame length, LB (Kalghatgi 1983) as

We calculate this integral numerically by dividing the flame surface into 1800 "tiles" (40 radial
divisions x 25 axial divisions of the conical surface, plus 400 tiles for each circular "cap"). The value
of the integrand is calculated at the center of each tile, and those values are added to produce an
estimate of the integral. This process is carried out for three orthogonal orientations of the
receiving surface, producing view factors 1f , 2 f , and 3f . The maximum view factor (over all
orientations of the receiving surface) is then calculated as

(For a true view factor, the integral omits portions of the radiating surface where β j cos <0. But
since 1f , 2 f , and 3f are used to calculate the maximum view factor, portions where β j cos <0 are
not excluded.)
6.5 POOL FIRES
There are 3 release scenarios that can be coupled with the Pool Fire model: The user may choose to
model a pool of constant area that is not associated with a tank release; the Pool Fire model can also
be coupled with a model that estimates the pool formation dynamics when a tank of chemical is
leaking; and the Pool Fire model is automatically applied to any fuel that pools during a BLEVE
scenario. In all cases, the pool is assumed to be circular, uniformly thick, and on a level surface. The
pool temperature is approximated as a constant and set to either the initial pool temperature or the
initial tank temperature. A 200-meter diameter limit applies in all cases.
A solid flame model is used to calculate the thermal radiation from pool fires. The size of the pool
can be set by the user, or ALOHA will calculate the dynamic area and volume from the release of a
liquid from a tank. The flames rising from the pool form a tilted cylinder; the surface of the cylinder
radiates thermal radiation. Burn rate, flame height, angle of tilt, and emission of radiation from the
surface are based on empirical correlations.
The thermal energy incident upon distant target is the product of the thermal radiation energy flux
at the surface of the flame, the geometric view factor, and the transmissivity of the atmosphere to
thermal radiation.
6.5.1 EMISSIVITY

Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models 77
where
h is the flame length (m),
d is the diameter of the pool (m),
∆hc is the heat of combustion (J kg-1),
m is the mass burn rate per unit area (kg m-2 s-1), and
frad is the fraction of energy released as thermal radiation.
ALOHA approximates the fraction of energy radiated, frad , as a constant 30% as suggested by
Roberts (Roberts 1982).
The mass burn rate per unit area, m , is calculated from ratios of the heats of combustion and
vaporization. Mudan states that the following correlation for the mass burning rate fits a wide
range of fuels including liquefied gases (Mudan 1984):
0.001 c

where
p c is the specific heat capacity (J kg-1 K-1),

T is the pool temperature (K).
6.5.2 VIEW FACTOR
The flame of the pool fire is assumed to be an optically dense tilted cylinder which intersects a
plane parallel to the ground in a circle. The flame length, h, is estimated by a modification of the

6.5.3 POOL DYNAMICS
The maximum diameter of the pool is used in all the above calculations. In cases where the pool
size is dynamic because chemical is released during a BLEVE or from a leaking tank, ALOHA uses
the same tank release and pool growth methods as those used for non-thermal hazards.
For tank release rates, ALOHA uses Bernoulli’s equation to compute QT(t) (kg s-1), the mass flow of
liquid from the hole,
( ) ( ) 2 Qt CA P P T = dis f h a l − ρ ,
where
Cdis is the discharge coefficient (0.61),
Af is the flow area (m2),
Ph is the pressure of the liquid in the tank at the height of the hole (Pa),
Pa is the ambient atmospheric pressure (Pa), and
ρl is the density of the liquid in the tank (kg m-3), which is assumed to be uniform throughout the
tank.
ALOHA estimates the flow area, Af (m2), differently depending on whether or not the liquid surface
intersects the hole. The flow area is
( ) ( )

/ surface intersects hole,

 = 

where
hl is the height of the liquid above the bottom of the hole (m), and
h ζ is either the hole height or diameter (m), depending on whether the hole is rectangular or
circular.
80 Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models
When the hole is below the liquid surface, ALOHA estimates the pressure at the hole as the sum of
the pressure within the gas void at the top of the tank and the pressure exerted by the column of
liquid above the bottom of
( )
surface above the hole,
surface intersects the hole,

e hg
P t
p hg
ρ

 +  = 
 +
where cs e , the saturated vapor pressure of the chemical (Pa), is assumed to be the pressure within
the void space.
Because ALOHA assumes that the sequence of pressure drop, evaporation of liquid into the void
space, and temperature change caused by evaporative cooling occurs rapidly during each new time
step, it computes a new temperature and saturated vapor pressure for the vapor in the void space.
As the liquid height above the hole bottom decreases, the pressure at the hole decreases until it
eventually equals atmospheric pressure. According to the physical model represented by ALOHA’s
algorithms, tank outflow then stops until an air bubble is ingested back into the tank, equalizing
tank and atmospheric pressure and allowing flow to continue as a series of gushes. To approximate
the effect of this process mathematically, once ALOHA’s computed pressure at the hole reaches 1.01
Pa, it is held constant at that value (Belore and Buist 1986).
If liquid spills into a puddle faster than the puddle burns, the puddle will grow deeper and will
spread outward under the influence of gravity. The puddle is approximated with uniform depth
and temperature. ALOHA estimates the change in puddle radius, p r , as
1 2
p p
p l
dr gm
dt r πρ = ,
where mp is the dynamic mass of the puddle, g is the acceleration of gravity, p r is the puddle
radius, and ρl is the density of the liquid in the puddle. ALOHA uses a constant factor of 2 to
account for the fact that the inertia of the spreading liquid is only a fraction of the inertia of the
whole liquid-pool mass moving with the acceleration at its leading edge (Briscoe and Shaw 1980).
When the puddle depth drops below 0.5 cm, ALOHA stops spreading; the area is held constant until
the liquid has completely burned away.
6.6 FLASH FIRES AND FLAMMABLE AREA
The Flammable Area analysis in ALOHA is designed to address the hazards associated with a fire or
explosion of a cloud composed of a mixture of flammable chemical vapors and air in proportions
that will support the propagation of a flame. The flammable area represents the region where an
ignition source can lead to a flash fire or vapor cloud explosion, and the area where the fire can
occur. While a vapor cloud explosion can generate a damaging shock waves outside the flammable
area, the fire hazard associated with a flash fire usually does not.
Thermal Radiation and Flammable Area Models 81
Typically with flash fires of premixed clouds, the thermal radiation generated is highly transient.
ALOHA does not explicitly model the thermal radiation associated with a flash fire, rather uses the
approach of the US EPA (United States. Environmental Protection Agency. Chemical Emergency
Preparedness and Prevention Office 1999) and assumes that the threat zone from a flash fire is
closely related to the lower flammability or explosive limit threat zone (ground level concentration
contour) for the cloud. Based upon recommendations of the project external review team the
choice was made to use 60% of the lower flammability limit as the level of concern in defining this
threat zone. This value reflects the fact that the concentration calculation in ALOHA involves some
time averaging. Therefore, there is the possibility that a location with an average concentration
below the LEL may have a fluctuating concentration that sometimes exceeds the LEL.
Modeling the thermal hazard associated with flash fires employs source strength models and air
dispersion models that are part of the toxic air plume analysis in ALOHA. Any location where the
gas concentration exceeds 60% of the LEL at any time following the release is included in the
hazard zone.
